# QuadroStride

QuadroStride is a research-based project proposed mainly for creation of an effective autonomous gait control system via reinforcement learning. The model presented in this solution is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and artificial neural network (ANN), and it effectively replaces the conventional analysis-based control theory, including inverse kinematics, differential equations of motion, and governing equations. The ANN model is trained using training data produced by DRL, and it is then utilised to operate a quadruped robot. A virtual replica of a typical quadruped robot is used to test the experimental validity of the proposed AI-based robot-control system. The efficiency of the agent will be evaluated with the help of Tensorboard. The entire project primarily runs on Unity Engine for the simulation based training and result demonstration. It utilizes Unity ML Agents for some of the core ML mechanics.
